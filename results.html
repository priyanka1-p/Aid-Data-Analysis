            <p>Figure 1: A network graph chart visualization to summarize aggregate of donations from the donor to multiple recipients across all years</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6 p-4 ps-md-0">
            <h5 class="mt-0">Network Graph:</h5>

            <p>The Figure 1 describes the relationship between donors and recipients based on the amount of money donated by the donor to the recipient and you can also observe how many recipients each donor has donated. For the network graph, the marks are going to be points and lines. Where points indicate the nodes and lines denote the links in the graph. Coming to channels we have area, shape, and color hue. The area indicates the amount of money donated or received whereas shape and color hue are used to categorize the donor and recipient</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Color : Different colors are used to represent the donor and recipient. Currently I am using one dark color (dark blue for the donor) and a bright dark color (purple for the recipient) but I believe they should be having a continuous color scale like shades of blue and purple to understand the variance in donation between them.</li>
              <li>Transformation : combining the data with year and Colesced_purpose_name will add a lot of information to the visualization and will make it more useful for the users to interpret the data in a particular way for which purpose the donor and recipient are doing the transaction.</li>
              <li>Animation or Interaction : Highlighting when clicked on donor it must show all recipients it has donated making it links visible and recipients respectively making everything else blur in the background which helps in increase the effectiveness of network graph.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The making use of the network graph the following user is able to identify the donations made by the donor to the following recipients across all years. For network graph giving users options to select multiple regions and compare them will be helpful. Here the use of scrolly telling will help in providing a very structured user interface but it may limit the user experience like interactivity, more load time, and information density. Should be very careful with real-time data updates and animation which may completely influence the visualization and lead the user to have a bad experience like for suppose if the data received is invalid and dummy data then this may lead the user to have a bad visualization for the following data. Some aggregating data can lead to data loss. I have observed the donor (Thailand) does not have any link with the recipient in the visualization even though the bond exists in the data which is not aggregated well. If the aggregation of the data is not done accurately by considering the relationship between the data, it will lead to inaccurate transformation of data.</p>

            <p>Figure 2: A Bar chart visualization to summarizeYearly breakdown of the donor's contributions to individual recipients, specifying the allocated amounts for specific needs.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6 p-4 ps-md-0">
            <h5 class="mt-0">Bar Chart:</h5>

            <p>The Figure 2 main purpose here is to discover and present the donations done by the donor to the recipient during a particular period for all the purposeful needs. Here AID data gives information about how much amount is donated by the donor to the recipient during a particular year and for which purpose the donation is done. For the stacked bar graph where I have used marks: lines and channels: area, color hue.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Color: Here we will be using categorical colormaps because our main aim in the stacked bar chart was to give unique colors for each purpose of donation so that they can be uniquely identified by the user just by looking at the graph. We have used discrete binning for the attribute (coalesced_purpose_name) to uniquely identify them. In our visualization, We should have perceptually distinct colors which will avoid confusion among the categories.</li>
              <li>Transformation: For the data we have created a calculated field by combining (donors, and recipients) which will help in forming the links between the nodes. So in creating the stacked bar chart, we ended up using the sum of the total amount donated for the bar size, the coalesced_purpose_name is used to categorize the following donation for which purpose it was named where it will be dividing the bar and its multiple segments with unique colors if the donation is made for multiple purposes by donor to the recipient. The year attribute has been added so that the user can see the following donations made by the user during a particular year.</li>
              <li>Animation/Interaction: We have added filters for year and donor because we want the user to be able to get the following information, how much amount is donated by this donor to all the recipients and for which purpose the donation was made. And for the filters, we have multiple options in Tableau where we can add them in the form of single value (list), single value (dropdown), single value (dropdown), single value (slider), multiple values (list), multiple values(drop down), multiple values (custom list).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While looking at the graph the user is given a choice to select the donor of their choice and in which particular year they would like to see the data of. This really help the user to understand the structure of the data and also it will really help the target users to understand the amount of donations made and to come to a conclusion about which of the following recipients will be requiring donation and for which purpose they would like to be donated.</p>

            <p>Figure 3: A sunburst chart visualization to summarize the donations made by donors in a particular year and across all years</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6 p-4 ps-md-0">
            <h5 class="mt-0">Sunburst Chart:</h5>

            <p>The Figure 3 describes about the donor-recipient relationships for Aid data. It shows how donors contribute to recipients over time. It also allows drill-down functionality which shows a list of recipient country names along with the percentage of the total amount they have received as aid contributions. The primary marks are segments representing donor-recipient relationships. Visual channels include color and size, with color representing financial commitment and size denoting the magnitude of commitments.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Color: The main use of choosing the drop-down for the selection of different colors is that the color choices should be accessible to all the users including the people who have color vision deficiencies. Less percentage values are represented in lighter luminance and high percentage values are represented in dark luminance.</li>
              <li>The default color used in representing the donors and recipients is the viridis color scale and this has served as a transformation theme in the sunburst chart. In the colors dropdown which is below the year's dropdown is used to change the sunburst chart image into different colors based on the selection of the color scale the color’s transformation will be done for the Sunburst chart.</li>
              <li>Animation / Interaction: An interactive Sunburst chart for Aid data visualization. The user can interactively select the 2 dropdowns year and color. In the sunburst chart when you click on each segment in the donor you will be expanded by the specific donor country giving clear information about that particular country.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The sunburst chart that we have created has three rings, the ring in the center contains all the years , second outer ring represents the donors and the third out ring represents the recipients. when clicked on a particular year all the other years in the surroundings will be erased and the user will the able to see the donors who have made donations to the recipients in the remaining two rings. If clicked on a particular donor during that particular year the user will be able to see all the recipients to which the donor has donated and when hovered over the recipient the user will be able to see the amount donated.</p>
