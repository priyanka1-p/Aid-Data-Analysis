--> To make use of the tableau work book we need to first download the tableau public app 
https://www.tableau.com/trial/download-tableau?utm_campaign_id=2017049&utm_campaign=Prospecting-CORE-ALL-ALL-ALL-ALL&utm_medium=Paid+Search&utm_source=Google+Search&utm_language=EN&utm_country=USCA&kw=download%20tableau%20desktop&adgroup=CTX-Brand-Download-E&adused=RESP&matchtype=e&placement=&d=7013y000000vYhH&nc=7013y0000029zDoAAI&cq_cmp=1695532942&cq_net=g&cq_plac=&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAsburBhCIARIsAExmsu4W-pfdQWPbsdf3bzsePzUSvr27r4ASJjAkm-CyUZs4p2YIWkvFbYkaAvvjEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds
--> After downloading and installing the app we can open our downloaded workbook and make sure you import the data inside the data source section.
-->In the following folder you will find two workbooks and data files of network graph and bar graph.

-->Coming to the pie chart visualization here we have used jupyter notebook. 
https://jupyter.org/install
-->After installing jupyter notebook you just import the data file and .ipynb into the cloud space of jupyter notebook. 
-->After mounting it just open the notebook file and start running each cell
--> Where in the end you will get an option to download the html version of the piechart visualization.

The main reason for saving the visualization in html format because we can import it in our website.
You may wonder how can we import the tableau visualizations, this can be done by publishing the visualization into tableau public.
After publishing it you will find a share option where you just copy/paste the code provided in your html page to import the following visualizations.
